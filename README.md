# Caesar Cipher Tool

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Tool repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm, complete with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Python and Tkinter.

## Project Overview

The Caesar Cipher Tool allows users to:
- Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Save encrypted or decrypted text to a file.
- Load text from a file for processing.
- Experience a user-friendly and modern interface for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Encryption & Decryption**: Encrypt or decrypt text with a shift value specified by the user.
- **Modern GUI**: A sleek, user-friendly interface designed with Tkinter to provide a seamless experience.
- **File Handling**: Save the processed text to a `.txt` file or load text from a `.txt` file.
- **Customizable Input**: Adjust the shift value and select encryption or decryption operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ERap2022/PRODIGY_CS_01
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd PRODIGY_CS_01
    ```

3. Install any required packages (if necessary):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python Ceaser_Cipher.py
    ```

2. The GUI will open. Enter the text you want to process and specify the shift value.

3. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the text using the radio buttons.

4. Click "Process" to see the result.

5. Use the "Save to File" button to save the result to a `.txt` file, or "Load from File" to load text from a `.txt` file into the input field.
